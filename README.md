# Final project for the course "Analítica en Deportes"

For the final project of the course "Analítica en Deportes", we developed a descriptive analysis of men's volleyball serves. The objective was to identify relationships between serve success and other variables, in order to provide insights to the Argentine Men’s Volleyball National Team. These insights could help guide training sessions by highlighting both strengths and weaknesses, and assist in planning strategies based on data-driven decisions.
